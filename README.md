# Usage

This uses SASS files for separation of CSS into various SCSS files. They're compiled using Compass. It's easier to use `grunt` to build the resultant CSS, but you'll need the following software packages:

## Requirements

- Node.js
- npm
- grunt
- compass

## Building

After installing the required dependencies, just type:

`$ npm install`

`$ grunt dev`
